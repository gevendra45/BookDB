First we have to load the csv into the sqllite db. 

For this I have build a script that creates the sqllite db using CSV file.
1. Database name Book is declared along with it columns.
2. Once finalized with above engine is created.
3. Data is appended into DB by render into CSV file excluding the header.

Flask Script is to fetch the data and create a session and host the flask webserver.

1. Session instance is created and data fetch is facilitated.
2. flask configrations are done and ran the server into main funtion.

Requirement.txt is to install all the library required.
Shell script to run the above two python file.
Dockerise the whole projects on the server.
